# Foundation decisions

## D1 — Retain the recovered translations

Keep the standard cache and overdraw implementations after checking the
upstream tables, traversal, arithmetic order and counting sort. Complete the
missing runner, provenance, docs and CI. Do not replace sound code merely to
restart the interrupted lane. No code from another Rust port was adopted.

The bounded reuse review found no locally qualified 1.3 implementation of
these modules. The Moss decoder is a later codec reuse candidate, not an
optimizer. Its current main source uses allocating Vec/String interfaces,
infallible output allocation and a narrower codec version domain; its reuse
still requires separate version, limits, no_std and parity qualification.
The external pure-Rust projects were not fetched or independently qualified.

## D2 — Checked borrowed views and explicit units

Primary indices are u32. Positions support packed XYZ, interleaved f32
elements and initialized bytes with explicit endianness. Float stride/offset
units are elements; byte units are bytes. Byte offsets may be unaligned;
strides retain upstream's multiple-of-four and 256-byte upper bound.
Attributes support up to 32 components and zero-component views. Validate
last-record addresses with checked arithmetic; never reinterpret arbitrary T.
Defer optional u16 convenience adapters to later demonstrated demand.

## D3 — Resource accounting and mutation guarantees

Preserve the RFC defaults: 1 GiB of crate-owned output plus retained scratch
capacity and 2^34 work units per call. Exclude caller-owned buffers, allocator
overhead and fixed stack arrays. Each algorithm counts validation and record
visits, as documented on Workspace; exact work boundaries have focused tests.
Use checked sizes and fallible reservation. Lowering limits releases scratch.

Allocating and in-place variants include a temporary output in the budget.
In-place errors are atomic. Caller-buffer variants avoid that output
allocation and preserve the tail; late work/numerical errors may modify the
used prefix, which is explicitly documented. Strong atomicity for `_into`
would require an unnecessary extra output allocation.

## D4 — Preserve accepted parameters and reject unsupported numbers

Retain all three opaque flags, combinations, empty flags and unknown-bit
rejection. Future simplifier consumers must enforce function-specific support.
Accept every finite overdraw threshold, including values below one; upstream
does not assert a minimum. Reject non-finite thresholds and all supplied
non-finite positions, including unused vertices. Reject overflowing geometric
intermediates instead of running undefined float-to-integer cases in C++.
The overdraw centroid still includes all finite supplied vertices.

## D5 — One math backend and scalar-strict oracle

Use pinned pure-Rust libm 0.2.16 through one internal interface in std and
no_std. The 65,543-value sqrtf probe agrees bit-for-bit with strict native C++
and executed wasm32 Rust, including signed zero and subnormals. Preserve f32
accumulation and tie order; use no fused or wider arithmetic.

Build unmodified upstream sources with the recorded scalar-strict flags.
The C++ driver checks nearest rounding and gradual underflow. Rust builds use
empty flags and compiler wrappers and a generic target. A stale inherited
compiler-cache temporary-directory setting initially broke MSRV compilation;
disabling the wrapper and using the isolated target's temporary directory
resolved it without changing the toolchain or source contract.

## D6 — Lane-specific fixture and target evidence

The 0.1 ledger contains all five required upstream geometry functions; two
are implemented here and the three simplification functions belong to lane 2.
The full later-release 89-name ledger is outside this lane's explicit scope.

Run every applicable upstream native fixture (the two emptyMesh calls), plus
17 corpus cases and 2,000 seeded cases per shipped function. Include meshes
with 1,000,002 indices, degeneracy, disconnection, unused vertices, varying
scales and thresholds. Read current Moss main at
`8d3cc0664948cfb7a779304382c1e8b79133fe2e` without changing its checkout;
the cooker and editor use threshold 1.05, matching the RFC's earlier baseline.
Overdraw comparisons use the verified standard-cache output as input.

Run all five upstream JS suites unchanged as sanity checks. Their only cache
fixture selects Strip, not the standard variant; retain that topology as an
extra Rust input without claiming Strip/fetch parity. No JS overdraw fixture
exists. The JS decoder's asynchronous count is not promoted to Rust coverage.

Execute identical messages in wasm32 and compare every response byte with
qualified native Rust. Retain inputs and C++/Rust/WASM outputs, seeds, counts,
statuses and SHA-256 source/dependency/binary identities. Reject changed
sources, missing backends, missing fixtures and missing or changed artifacts.
Linux AArch64 and complete release qualification remain later gates.

## D7 — Stable ten-minute fuzz fallback

Use two deterministic bounded mutation targets because cargo-fuzz and nightly
are not installed. Each ran 600 elapsed seconds with no crashes: 64,143,023
cache executions and 107,305,797 overdraw executions. Check successful triangle
invariants, resource bounds, destination tails, variant identity and atomic
in-place failures; exercise malformed topology, layouts, flags and float bits.
Retain seeds, iteration diagnostics, execution/success counts and actual
elapsed/CPU/RSS measurements. This lacks sanitizer and coverage instrumentation
and does not replace the later 24-CPU-hour gate.

## D8 — Package listing without Git changes

Cargo refuses even `cargo package --list` when the unpublished package's files
are uncommitted. Committing or changing Git state conflicts with the brief.
Run that exact command in a temporary source-identical export without Git
metadata, compare its inventory with `cargo package --list --allow-dirty` in
the real working tree, and verify all included original-file hashes. The
package excludes parity, fuzz and CI. Retain the direct refusal and the
successful adjusted gate in results/gates.json. No Git metadata is modified.

## D9 — Publish dry run without remote access

Cargo's default crates.io dry run fails before packaging in offline mode,
including with an isolated cache and Cargo 1.88. Preserve the no-remote-fetch
constraint by running the exact `cargo publish --dry-run --allow-dirty`
command against a temporary loopback sparse registry. Vendor locked libm
offline with Cargo, verify the actual package build, record the two local
metadata requests and confirm there is no upload. Retain the verified crate
archive and its SHA-256. This qualifies packaging, not crates.io availability
or registry readiness; the literal default-registry offline command remains
unavailable. `gates.sh` reproduces both D8 and D9 explicitly.

The RFC's dated name check is accepted prior evidence, not a reservation.
No external naming request was made in this lane. Repeat real registry name
checks before any publication, as the RFC requires.

## D10 — Record performance without enforcing a release bar

Measure allocating APIs single-threaded on a 1,000,000-triangle grid, with
ten interleaved Rust/C++ paired samples and a warm-up. Include validation,
scratch/output allocation and execution; exclude generation, I/O and process
startup. Record medians, dispersion, raw samples and identities. Scalar-strict
C++ is appropriate for these modules, which have no explicit SIMD paths.
The lane's requested benchmark is recorded only; `--enforce` rejects an
unsupported qualification claim. Broader workloads, caller-buffer benchmarks,
release performance bars and Moss migration are deferred by lane scope.

## D11 — Simplifier API and stable options

Port the pinned edge-collapse implementation directly, including its half-seam,
complex/fringe classification, wedge traversal, quadric arithmetic, direction
selection and stable 12-bit counting sort. Provide allocating and caller-buffer
variants, original vertex references, and bit-preserved linear result error.
Target counts are index counts and may be nonmultiples of three. A target is
not a guarantee. Scale is allocation-free and returns the extent without an
epsilon clamp; it needs no Workspace argument.

Expose empty options and Permissive, plus LockBorder, ErrorAbsolute, Regularize
and RegularizeLight because these share the implemented paths. Sparse and Prune
need separate algorithms; defer them and all experimental options. Reject their
bits rather than silently approximating behavior. All LOCK/PROTECT/PRIORITY
combinations are accepted for attribute simplification. Priority examines the
canonical vertex, as upstream does, and does not guarantee preservation.

Read Moss main without checkout changes at
`eddd56d1ba95b8bd2e1b8f9296bf080a86801a0e`. Cooker/editor use empty options;
the cooker retry uses Permissive and Boolean locks, mapped to LOCK/empty.
No LockBorder call was found. Cooker targets are 0.5/0.25/0.125 with error
`max(1-ratio, 0.05)`. The editor currently multiplies that error by its clamped
scale before calling relative mode; qualification includes those actual inputs
without changing the consumer. Current cooker attributes are normal xyz,
UV, tangent xyz (weights 2/2/2/1/1/1/1/1), plus optional RGBA (weight 8 each).
Opposite tangent handedness is locked by the consumer. Moss integration remains
outside this lane.

## D12 — Scratch, work and numerical contracts

Keep typed simplifier scratch local to each call. Charge every fallibly reserved
capacity, output capacity and pre-existing retained Workspace capacity against
the same byte limit before using it. Release local scratch on return; Usage
reports the peak. Reusing typed simplifier scratch is a later performance choice,
not required for correctness. Caller-buffer variants reserve/validate first and
may modify the input-length prefix on a later failure, matching D3.

Count validation, hash probes, vertex/adjacency visits, edge searches, quadric
and attribute accumulation, collapse candidates, ranking, counting-sort visits,
flip checks and remapping. Fixed scalar arithmetic and fixed-size histogram work
are not separate units. Tests establish exact work and byte boundaries.

Reject non-finite supplied attributes even when their weight is zero, and
non-finite unused positions. Reject overflowing rescale/quadric/result
intermediates. Preserve upstream's internal absolute-error cutoff calculation,
including its zero-extent division behavior; do not reject an empty or
coincident mesh just because that internal cutoff is non-finite. The public
error limit itself must always be finite and nonnegative. These checked input
and allocation failures intentionally differ from C++ assertions/undefined cases.

## D13 — Final-source evidence and external artifacts

Interpret the brief's default `target/parity-artifacts` as the isolated
`$CARGO_TARGET_DIR/parity-artifacts`; a repository-local default would contradict
its explicit outside-repository requirement. Reject any MESHOPT_ARTIFACTS path
inside this checkout. Retain this lane's archives at
`/mnt/linux-extra/moss-capture-archive/meshopt-lane2`, independently of the
throwaway build target. JSON contains archive/member hashes and metadata only.
Remove the hostname field from both parity and fuzz hardware identities.

Re-run all five functions against final sources. Capture applicable upstream
native fixture inputs before their in-place calls, preserving the original
fixture bodies/assertions, and capture six applicable JS calls with an adapter
while separately executing all five unchanged JS suites. Uint16 JS input is
widened explicitly to the crate's u32 topology API. Record a fixed required
fixture inventory so a missing fixture fails qualification. Remaining native/JS
simplifier options and functions are excluded explicitly in COVERAGE.md.

Use native scalar-strict C++ for exact indices and f32 error bits; execute the
same messages in wasm32 and require native-Rust byte identity. Run 2,000 seeded
cases per entry point, and stable bounded mutation for 600 elapsed seconds per
entry point, retaining D7's instrumentation limits. Benchmarks use the D10
single-threaded allocating method on one million triangles at all three cooker
target ratios, with eight weighted attributes and Permissive for the attribute
entry point. No performance optimization is authorized in this lane.

## D14 — Package inventory with existing Git history

Lane 1's D8 export comparison assumed an unborn repository. This checkout has
history, so Cargo additionally generates `.cargo_vcs_info.json` in the working
repository's package inventory. The Git-free export cannot generate that file.
Compare the exact source inventories with this one generated metadata entry
excluded, record both full inventories, and continue verifying every included
source hash. The actual publish dry run still builds the real working-tree
package, including Cargo's dirty VCS metadata. Do not create synthetic Git
history, stage files, or change any Git metadata to make inventories match.

Current Cargo places the dry-run archive under `package/tmp-crate/`, while
lane 1 expected `package/`. Accept either documented observed output location,
require exactly one candidate, and hash/copy that archive. The temporary
registry copy was checked to have the same bytes; do not mistake it for a
second independent package build.

## D15 — No implicit allocating result clone

Do not implement Clone for SimplifiedMesh: a derived Vec clone would expose an
infallible crate-provided allocation outside Workspace accounting. Callers own
the returned Vec and can explicitly choose their own copying policy. Settings,
options and caller-buffer results remain Copy because they allocate nothing.

## D16 — Measure the geometry matrix and enforce the original bars

Replace the single-grid benchmark with 204 cases: 32, 8,192 and 1,000,000
triangles; smooth, duplicate-boundary seam patches, disconnected patches and
50-percent referenced vertex arrays; both allocating and caller-buffer APIs.
Scale has one allocation-free API. Plain simplification covers targets 0.5,
0.25 and 0.125. Attribute simplification pairs those targets with 1, 8 and 12
components. This is representative coverage, not every attribute/ratio pair.

Use one warm-up per driver invocation and at least ten alternating paired
samples. Tiny samples average 64 calls to reduce clock overhead. If the paired
ratio interquartile range straddles a time bar, collect up to thirty pairs.
Record start/end load for each attempt; repeat cases once when load exceeds
four and retain both attempts. Persistent high load limits confidence and is
not grounds to relax a gate. Retain nonpositive clock intervals and their raw
responses, then retry at most three times; fail if no positive interval results.

Time validation, required copies and the selected API, excluding protocol
serialization. Measure C++ peak requested scratch with its allocator callback
during the untimed warm-up, then disable allocation tracking for timing.
Include output capacity for allocating APIs and exclude caller buffers on both
sides. Rust measurements include retained Workspace capacity. Report each
case, each family geometric mean and maximum, and the unchanged 1.25 time
mean, 1.50 case and 1.25 memory bars. `--enforce` fails when any bar fails.

The expanded before run was intentionally stopped after all tiny/medium cases
and initial million-triangle diagnostics. Retain its partial record externally;
do not describe it as a complete baseline. The prior lane's recorded table is
also retained. Final acceptance requires the complete new matrix.

## D17 — Compact and bound simplifier scratch

Keep the public API unchanged. Store internal topology indices as u32 after
existing topology validation; convert to usize at slice access. Store collapse
candidates in twelve bytes, reusing the error slot for the pre-ranking direction
flag, as upstream does. Allocate candidates from the computed collapse bound,
reserve fallibly and push initialized records instead of zeroing records that
are immediately overwritten. Pre-slice attribute and gradient rows in scoring.

These changes reduce scratch bandwidth and allocation/initialization time.
All 43 tests, the corpus and 2,000 seeded cases per function passed after this
change, including native C++ comparison and executed wasm32 identity.

## D18 — Allocate overdraw scratch from live clusters

Reuse the dead hard-boundary buffer for sort order. Allocate floating sort
values and keys for the actual soft-cluster count instead of every triangle.
Preserve the upstream counting sort and tie order. Consolidate finite checks
only where a nonfinite intermediate necessarily propagates to a checked
result, without changing arithmetic order. Reserve histogram work once.
The corpus and 2,000 seeded cases per function passed with zero mismatches,
including wasm32 identity, after this change.

## D19 — Dispatch sequential position scans once and count work down

Dispatch packed position storage once before sequential bounds/centroid/value
scans. Count work down from the available budget, preserving overflow checks
on the cold failure path. This removes one hot overflow check per counted
visit without changing successful counts or limits. All differential corpus
and sweep cases passed again, including wasm32 identity.

Keep the pinned software libm backend for both std and no_std. Do not enable
architecture-specific unsafe kernels in a dependency to hide a safety-policy
change. `perf` cannot run because the installed wrapper has no matching kernel
tools; use gprofng sampling and retain the experiments outside the checkout.

## D20 — Inline checked accessors and pre-slice cache adjacency

Profiles identified calls to Positions::get in overdraw. Add inline hints to
checked position/attribute accessors, preserving every bounds/layout check.
Pre-slice each cache adjacency search and iterate its records before swapping
the found record with the last one. This preserves traversal and work counts
while exposing the contiguous search to the compiler. Both changes separately
passed the corpus and 2,000 seeded cases per function, including wasm32.

Release harness builds retain line tables for gprofng attribution. The profile
runner chooses the slowest million-triangle case per family from the completed
matrix and verifies its output against the retained benchmark. Profile samples
identify measured costs; they do not prove that every possible safe Rust
implementation must have the same performance.

## D21 — Buffer driver I/O outside timing

The first final-matrix attempt exposed substantial process overhead from the
C++ driver's byte-at-a-time stream operations on million-triangle messages.
Retain that interrupted run as `pre-io-benchmark.partial.json` externally.
Read bounded 64 KiB blocks and serialize responses into a byte vector outside
the timed region. Keep the same protocol, size checks, float bits and algorithm
timing boundaries. Re-run the full native/WASM corpus and sweep, then restart
the complete matrix. The five completed fuzz targets exercise unchanged Rust
sources, so this driver-only change does not invalidate their 300-second runs.

## D22 — Pair resident drivers with one warm-up

The process-per-sample runner reparsed each large input and repeated warm-up
for every pair. Replace that orchestration with two resident native drivers.
Each backend parses and warms up once per attempt, signals readiness, and runs
only when the parent sends its next sample trigger. Alternate backends for each
pair, then request final outputs and the complete timing stream. Verify the
stream against the individually received samples and compare final outputs
exactly. IPC, parsing and serialization remain outside timing. Keep tiny-call
batching, adaptive sample counts and high-load repeats.

Retain the prior interrupted record as `pre-paired-benchmark.partial.json`.
The final record identifies the paired protocol, every sample's backend order,
all attempts and their complete responses. This supersedes D16's invocation-
per-pair detail; the workload matrix and bars are unchanged. The native/WASM
parity and build gates are rerun for the final harness. Rust library and fuzz
sources remain unchanged since the completed five-minute smoke.

The first resident-driver run stopped after four nonpositive clock intervals;
it is retained as `clock-failure-benchmark.partial.json`. Add explicit `T`
sample framing so an unexpected response cannot be interpreted as a duration.
Pin both backends to the same allowed CPU and record that CPU in the result;
this removes cross-core placement as a source of comparison bias and reduces
migration-related timing uncertainty. Retain invalid intervals and fail after
the bounded retry budget; do not replace them with invented timings.

## D23 — Verify inlining in emitted code

Ordinary inline hints left four Positions::get call sites in overdraw's emitted
kernel. Force-inline the checked XYZ accessor and its checked internal adapter.
The pinned million-triangle smooth overdraw probe improved from approximately
3.7–3.8 times C++ to 1.69 times C++; these are diagnostic measurements, not the
full-matrix verdict. The corpus and complete seeded sweep passed again.

The longer attribute profile attributed 13.16 percent of sampled CPU time to
attribute_error and another 13.16 percent to rank itself. Force-inline the
pre-sliced attribute scoring helper into its callers; preserve accumulation
order and the same checked slices. The corpus and seeded sweep passed after
this separate change as well. Final qualification reruns fuzzing because these
last changes modify published Rust sources.

## D24 — Check nonnegative area accumulation once per cluster

The longer overdraw profile attributed 28.22 percent of sampled CPU time to
software sqrtf and 54.50 percent to the kernel; floating-point classification
was a prominent inlined cost. Remove the per-triangle finite check immediately
before sqrt: a nonfinite squared norm produces a nonfinite area, and adding
nonnegative areas cannot make that result finite. The existing checked area
sum still rejects it before output writes. Keep the separate normal-length
check, where taking the reciprocal of infinity could otherwise hide overflow.
No floating-point operation or summation order changes.

Add a boundary test with finite edges and cross product but overflowing squared
area. All 44 tests and the corpus/seeded sweep passed. The focused smooth
million-triangle overdraw ratio fell to about 1.41; use the final matrix for
acceptance rather than treating this probe as qualification.

## D25 — Store cache vertex fields together

Keep live count, adjacency offset and score in one twelve-byte internal record.
This replaces the separate vertex arrays, preserving their total requested
storage and traversal order while sharing bounds checks and cache lines during
scoring. Keep adjacency, triangle scores and emitted flags in their existing
scratch vectors. Charge retained typed capacity in every Workspace operation
and release it in clear/set_limits; cross-operation retention remains charged.
No public API changes. All tests and differential corpus/sweep cases passed.
The focused million-triangle cache ratio improved to about 1.27.

## D26 — Expose independent attribute terms to auto-vectorization

Compute attribute-error terms in groups of four, then add each term to the
running result in original component order. Preserve every term's multiplication
and addition order; there is no horizontal or reassociated reduction. Handle the
tail with the original scalar sequence. Emitted rank code contains packed
multiply/add instructions under the existing generic target, with no intrinsics
or unsafe code. The focused attribute probe improved to about 1.19 times C++.
The corpus and complete seeded sweep remained exact, including wasm32.

Add a separate resource regression proving that another operation charges the
retained cache-vertex buffer and that clear releases it. Final validation has
45 API tests in each feature mode. None of these changes alters public APIs.

## D27 — What made it faster

- Compact simplifier topology to u32 and collapse records to twelve bytes;
  reserve the proven candidate bound and push candidates without redundant zeroing.
- Allocate overdraw sort scratch for actual clusters and reuse dead boundary
  storage. Keep finite checks at points where nonfinite values cannot disappear.
- Dispatch sequential position scans once and force-inline checked position
  access after emitted code showed that ordinary inline hints were insufficient.
- Keep cache live counts, offsets and scores together, and pre-slice adjacency
  searches to share checks and improve locality.
- Pre-slice attribute rows and expose four independent terms to compiler
  vectorization while retaining the original scalar accumulation order.
- Count work down from the budget, leaving overflow handling on the cold
  failure path. Preserve fallible allocation, resource limits and public APIs.

Reject unsafe access/intrinsics, a hidden dependency kernel, reassociated
floating-point reductions, relaxed comparisons, and a reduced workload matrix.
The pinned software math backend remains unchanged. The corpus and complete
seeded sweep passed after each library optimization; the final fuzz smoke is
300 seconds per function, as requested for this lane.

The benchmark measures one warm-up and 10–30 paired samples per backend and
attempt, with 64 calls per tiny sample. Both backends share the recorded CPU.
Every case with start or end load above four is repeated, and both attempts
remain auditable. A profile identifies observed costs; it cannot establish a
universal lower bound for every possible safe implementation.

## D28 — Keep performance acceptance failed

The complete 204-case matrix exits zero and records **FAIL** against the
unchanged RFC bars. Do not mark the performance goal achieved. Keep the safe
optimizations and exact-parity evidence; no public API changed and no Git
mutation was performed.

| Family | Brief's starting 1M ratio | Final matrix geometric mean | Final maximum | Maximum memory ratio | Verdict |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---|
| Vertex cache | 1.51 | 1.322 | 1.477 | 1.000 | FAIL: mean |
| Overdraw | 2.62 | 1.272 | 1.477 | 0.999 | FAIL: mean |
| Simplify | 1.55–1.67 | 1.313 | 1.574 | 1.064 | FAIL: mean and case |
| Attributes | 1.47–1.75 | 1.313 | 1.490 | 1.043 | FAIL: mean |
| Scale | 1.33 | 0.929 | 1.063 | 1.000 | PASS |

The starting column is supplied by the brief, not a controlled before/after
measurement of this expanded matrix. The separately archived lane 2 record
has different historical ratios: cache 1.320, overdraw 2.406, simplify
1.553–1.675, attributes 1.467–1.750 and scale 1.334. It remains at
`/mnt/linux-extra/moss-capture-archive/meshopt-lane3/lane2-benchmark.json`.
Neither historical single-grid table establishes a full-matrix speedup.

Both individual time failures are medium sparse simplification at target 0.5:
allocating 1.519 and caller-buffer 1.574. The latter takes median 1.834467 ms
versus C++ 1.165346 ms. This is the measured residual, not a demonstrated lower
bound. The other families fail only their mean, except scale which passes.
All memory measurements pass.

The matrix ran for 43.89 minutes. Load started at 11.92 and ended at 6.70;
all 204 cases required a repeat and all remained above four. Both attempts,
raw samples, dispersion and backend order are retained. No invalid clock
interval occurred. These conditions limit confidence; they do not turn a
failed bar into a pass.

Final-source gprofng experiments select the slowest measured million-triangle
case per family. Cache samples concentrate in its kernel. Overdraw samples
include the geometry kernel and software sqrt. Plain simplification samples
concentrate in rank, perform, adjacency and initialization; attributes also
spend time constructing quadrics. A separate medium sparse experiment ran
10,000 timed calls and checked every response against the benchmark. Its
samples include ranking, adjacency, initialization and software sqrt.

The collector reports timer-period changes and substantially undercounts
sampled time. The repeated experiment also warns about replacing vfork with
fork; all child experiments are selected. Headers, warnings, experiment lists,
function/line reports and response hashes are retained in `results/profiles.json`,
`results/medium-residual-profile.json`, and the external `final/profiles` and
`final/medium-residual` directories. Treat these as diagnostic attribution,
not calibrated CPU percentages, a proof of the entire C++ gap, or a proof that
no other safe implementation can meet the bar. The brief's alternative
impossibility stopping condition has **not** been established. Performance
qualification remains open; further work needs reliable profiling and measured
safe improvements, not a weaker threshold or an unsafe exception.

Final correctness/build evidence: fmt, clippy with warnings denied, both
feature-mode test runs (45 each), wasm32 build, native/C++/WASM corpus identity,
10,000 seeded differential cases and five upstream JS suites all pass. Five
fuzz targets ran 300 seconds each, totaling 554,090,714 executions and zero
crashes. Stable fuzzing has no sanitizer or coverage instrumentation. This
lane does not refresh legacy package/release gates or claim AArch64 execution.

Verify all current source identities, archive members, sample medians, family
aggregates and executable hashes before retaining binaries and a source archive.
Then remove exactly `/mnt/linux-extra/moss-cargo-targets/codex-meshopt-lane3`.
Large artifacts remain at
`/mnt/linux-extra/moss-capture-archive/meshopt-lane3/final`.
